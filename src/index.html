<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- is what comments start with
  and end with. A comment is code not run -->
<!-- Doctype is a way to communicate and let the browser know how to render (or display)
  a given document
-->
<!-- https://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html :
  The simplest and most reliable doctype declaration to use is the one defined in HTML5:
-->
<html>
  <!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html
    The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document,
      so it is also referred to as the root element.
      All other elements must be descendants of this element.
   -->
  <head>
    <!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head
      The HTML <head> element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document,
        like its title, scripts, and style sheets.
    -->
    <title>This is my first title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body
      The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document.
        There can be only one <body> element in a document.
    -->
    This is my first web page.
  </body>
</html>
